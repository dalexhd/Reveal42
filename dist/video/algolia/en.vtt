00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.640
Search, it's our
window into the world

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.960
Our favourite apps help us
interact with it

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.680
in ways we never could before

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.360
connecting us with our friends

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.640
helping us decide
which new gadget to buy

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.320
and even finding us answers to
life's most pressing questions

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.320
Your users see your search bar

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.280
as a conversation
with your product

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.600
they don't want to have to think
about how they should phrase

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.600
what they're looking for

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.640
that's where Algolia comes in

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.720
Algolia provides product teams
with a set of building blocks

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.920
for creating the search
experience your users expect

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.000
relevant, personalised,
intuitive and fast

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.400
really fast

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.120
With InstantSearch results that
mean larger shopping cart sizes

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.160
Autocomplete search that helps
find answers faster

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.960
And dropdown menus that
know you better than you do

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.880
For developers, Algolia's
easy-to-use API clients

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.200
intuitive UX tools
and integrations

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.440
mean you can get powerful
search up in minutes

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.840
As you scale, our dashboard
and support helps you identify

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.360
opportunities to
customise Algolia

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.200
You can even integrate
your own analytics tools

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.480
to see how search is affecting
your business as a whole

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.720
Algolia's lightning fast
as-you-type experience

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.880
handles synonyms

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.040
and it's typo-tolerant

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.960
That means users
won't even notice

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.720
they spelled Rihanna's
name wrong

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.400
and still found her latest hits

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.040
and isn't that the point?

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.240
Because when it comes to
exploring the world around us

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.240
we shouldn't ever be held back

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.640
That's why Algolia
is search made right
