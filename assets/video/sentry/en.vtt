Sentry lets you identify and fix

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.779
production errors across every

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.090
application in your stack start by

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.349
installing the appropriate SDK for your

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.540
platform or platforms once this is done

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.230
all unhandled exceptions are

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
automatically captured by century and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.400
individual errors are rolled up into

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.000
larger issues that allow you to see the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.320
impact of specific problems examine the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.710
stack trace get added context about the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.250
application state and connect the issue

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
to the commit that likely caused it

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.969
since we're full stack if a front-end

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.190
error is caused by something broken in

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.910
your back-end code you can trace that

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.280
within century you can assign these

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.260
issues to a developer or team directly

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
within century or through an issue

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.129
tracker and will send you notifications

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.439
about problems via alerts that you fully

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:08.390
control century fix problems shipboard

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.390
code take the occasional nap
