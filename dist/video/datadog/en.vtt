00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.280
If you're running an application at scale
in public or private clouds,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.500
you have to tame almost boundless complexity

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.080
thousands of hosts

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.660
tens of thousands of containers

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.800
multiple infrastructure platforms.
All of them generating a

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.940
steady stream of data about their health,
work, and performance

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.240
Datadog brings together all this observability data,
with infrastructure metrics, traces, and logs

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.420
in one integrated platform

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.440
you can collect data from hundreds of technologies

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.340
for visualization, troubleshooting, machine learning, alerting, and more

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.960
visualize your entire
infrastructure for a bird's-eye view

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.060
sort and filter your hosts using
automatically generated tags

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.420
and dive in for a detailed view of any host or container

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.340
see how all your services interact

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.700
and automatically map your
dependencies to find bottlenecks in your application

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.800
if you see something
interesting on a dashboard you can drill

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.300
into related processes, hosts, or logs
for more information

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.860
your processed logs automatically capture details like
error messages from your application

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.720
for more context, you can pivot to end-to-end
traces to see how the user request was carried out

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.560
along with the full stack trace from the error

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.700
when you need to find the source of an issue

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.120
faceted search helps you quickly drill into
all your traces and logs

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.030
here we're searching our traces for a specific

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.400
customer, service, endpoint, and error code

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.100
Datadog automatically alerts you via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and other tools

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.900
about any issue in your infrastructure or applications

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.560
so you'll find out immediately about any
unexpected traffic spikes,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.780
elevated latency, or looming capacity limits

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.960
using automated browser tests run
from around the globe

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.979
you can even find out when your users are unable

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.460
to complete critical actions like
signing up for an account

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.120
and with machine learning features like Watchdog

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.080
Datadog automatically detects performance anomalies anywhere in your systems

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.740
and surfaces correlated troubleshooting data,
so you can identify the root cause faster

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.400
in any stack, for any app, at any scale, anywhere

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.600
Datadog brings together metrics, traces, and logs

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.699
so you can tame the complexity of the
modern cloud age
